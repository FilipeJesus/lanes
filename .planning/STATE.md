## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Per-session agent selection with global default (pending during roadmap)
- Basic sessions only - no workflow/MCP for Codex in this milestone (pending)
- No sidebar visual differentiation for agent type - user preference (pending)
- Alternative status tracking for Codex due to lack of hook system (pending)
- Exported DEFAULTS constant from ClaudeSessionProvider for reuse across services (01-01)
- Kept fallback ternaries for backward compatibility when no CodeAgent is configured (01-01)
